# Threat Hunting Branching Chain Example
# This script demonstrates how to use branching chains in LangChain to create
# a threat hunting workflow that adapts based on the type of indicator.
# The chain will classify an indicator, then branch to specialized analysis
# paths for different indicator types (IP, domain, file hash, or behavior pattern).
