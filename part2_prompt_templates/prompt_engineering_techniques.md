# Prompt Engineering Techniques
The following table lists various advanced prompting techniques used to enhance the reasoning, reliability, and adaptability of large language models (LLMs). Each row describes a distinct technique—such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, ReAct, or Self-Correction—along with a brief explanation, a key idea for how to implement it in a prompt, and notes on how it can be integrated within LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) or LangGraph. These techniques range from structured reasoning patterns like Tree-of-Thought to meta-level methods like Iterative Refinement and System-Level Instructions, and are foundational for building more robust, interpretable, and interactive LLM-powered systems.


| Technique                     | Brief Description                                                                 | Key Idea for Prompting                                                                                   | Potential LangChain/LangGraph Implementation Note                                                                                                                                       |

| Chain-of-Thought (CoT)       | Encourages LLM to generate intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at an answer. | Add "Let's think step by step" or provide few-shot examples of step-by-step problem-solving in the prompt. | Can be part of a prompt for any LLM call in LCEL or a LangGraph node.                                                                                                                  |
| Tree-of-Thought (ToT)        | Extends CoT by allowing exploration and evaluation of multiple reasoning paths.     | Prompt to "Explore N strategies, analyze pros/cons, then select the best."                                | Complex; may involve LangGraph with parallel branches for exploring paths and a subsequent node for evaluation and selection.                                                         |
| Self-Consistency             | Generates multiple diverse reasoning paths (e.g., CoTs) and selects the most frequently occurring/consistent answer. | Prompt the LLM multiple times (perhaps with varied temperature) for the same problem.                     | Can be implemented by running an LCEL chain multiple times in parallel or sequentially, followed by an aggregation/voting step (custom function or LangGraph node).                   |
| ReAct (Reason+Act)           | Interleaves reasoning (Thought) with actions (Tool Use) and observations.          | Prompt must guide the LLM to produce "Thought:", "Action:", "Action Input:" and process "Observation:". Few-shot examples are highly effective. | Natively supported by LangChain agent executors. Can be built from scratch using LangGraph for more control (nodes for thought/action generation, tool execution, and conditional looping). |
| Self-Correction/Reflection   | Agent reflects on its outputs or actions, identifies errors, and attempts to correct them. | Prompt for evaluation: "Is this answer correct/relevant? If not, why? How can it be improved?"            | LangGraph is ideal: a node generates, another evaluates, conditional edges route to refinement/regeneration nodes or continue. E.g., Self-reflective RAG.                              |
| Meta Prompting               | A two-step process: AI first generates a structured prompt based on user input, then uses that to produce an answer. | Initial prompt asks AI to refine/restructure the user's query or generate clarifying questions before answering. | Can be a sequence of two LCEL chains or two LangGraph nodes. The first node generates the "meta-prompt," the second uses it.                                                           |
| Iterative Refinement         | The process of analyzing AI output and tweaking/restructuring prompts for better results. | Not a direct prompt to the LLM, but a developer methodology.                                              | Applicable to all prompt engineering. Involves testing variations of prompts within chains/graphs.                                                                                     |
| System-Level Instructions    | Explicitly defining the AI's persona, role, tone, and high-level directives.       | Use the "system" message in ChatPromptTemplate or the initial part of a prompt to set overall behavior.   | Standard practice for ChatPromptTemplate in LCEL and system messages for agent prompts in LangGraph.                                                                                  |
| Contextual Priming           | Embedding relevant background information directly into the prompt.                | Include specific context, data, or examples within the prompt text that the LLM should use.              | Context can be dynamically fetched (e.g., RAG) and inserted into the prompt template variables in LCEL or LangGraph state.                                                             |
