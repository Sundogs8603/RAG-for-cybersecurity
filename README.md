# AI Agents for Cybersecurity

This repository contains resources and materials for [several courses](https://www.oreilly.com/search/?q=omar%20santos&rows=100) by [Omar Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santosomar/).

# Repository Structure
The repository is structured with five comprehensive parts covering the spectrum from basic AI concepts to advanced agentic implementations:

- **`part1_basic_examples_no_rag/`**: Foundational examples covering chat models, embeddings, interactive chatbots, and integration with various model providers (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ollama)
- **`part2_prompt_templates/`**: Advanced prompt engineering techniques, template systems, and structured prompting strategies for cybersecurity applications
- **`part3_prompt_chaining/`**: Sophisticated prompt chaining workflows using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), including branching chains, parallel processing, and conditional logic
- **`part4_rag_examples/`**: Comprehensive Retrieval Augmented Generation implementations with vector databases, text splitting strategies, and metadata handling
- **`part5_agents_and_tools/`**: Advanced AI agents, tools integration, LangGraph workflows, agentic RAG, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations
