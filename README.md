# Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Langchain, and Agentic Implementatiosn for Cybersecurity Operations Course

This repository contains resources and materials for the ["RAG and AI Applications for Cybersecurity and Networking Professionals"](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/rag-and-ai-applications-for-cybersecurity-and-networking-professionals/0642572008474/0642572008473/) and other courses by Omar Santos.

## Course Overview

This course is an exploration of using RAG, Langchain, LangGraph, and LLMs; and their practical applications in both offensive and defensive security operations.

This is a basic-to-intermediate-level course designed for security professionals who are looking to enhance their knowledge and skills in AI technologies for cybersecurity. Participants should have a basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts and some experience with AI and machine learning. 

Get the introduction to cutting-edge AI topics such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Langchain, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex. This 4-hour course will show you how to harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations, as well as networking implementations. From enhancing threat detection to automating complex ethical hacking tasks, this course provides practical skills that are reshaping today’s cybersecurity and networking landscape.

RAG and AI Applications for Cybersecurity and Networking Professionals goes beyond theoretical concepts, offering hands-on experience with real-world step-by-step AI coding examples. Whether you're a red team operator looking to develop more sophisticated attacks, a blue team analyst seeking to bolster defenses, a security researcher exploring the frontiers of AI in cybersecurity or a networking professional in need of AI knowledge, this course provides the core basics and skills needed to stay ahead in today’s environments. You will learn about traditional RAG, RAG Fusion, and implementations and how to use solutions like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and vector databases including Chroma DB, pgvector, Pinecone, FAISS, and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. We will also introduce AI agents and agentic frameworks such as LangGraph and others.

**Note**: This will continue to be a **living set of resources** with updates and new content added regularly.
