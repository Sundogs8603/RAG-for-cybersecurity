## Key Features

- **Agent Architectures**: Multiple agent implementations from basic to complex
- **Tool Integration**: Examples of integrating security tools and APIs
- **Memory Management**: Conversation and context retention techniques
- **Workflow Management**: LangGraph-based complex decision flows
- **Security Focus**: Cybersecurity-specific implementations and use cases

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- LangChain and LangGraph
- OpenAI API access
- Additional security tools as required by specific examples

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
   - OpenAI API key
   - Other required API credentials
3. Review individual README files in subdirectories
4. Start with basic examples before moving to complex implementations

## Usage Examples

Each subdirectory contains specific usage examples and documentation. Start with:
1. Basic agent examples to understand core concepts
2. Move to agent deep dive for advanced features
3. Explore agentic RAG for information retrieval
4. Study MCP servers for API integration

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests with:
- New agent examples
- Additional security tools
- Improved documentation
- Bug fixes and optimizations

## Usage

Run the script using Python:
```bash
python basic_agent_and_tools.py
```

The script will:
1. Load the necessary environment variables
2. Create a custom time tool
3. Initialize the LangChain agent with the ReAct framework
4. Execute a test query asking for the current time
5. Display the response


## Features

- Custom tool implementation
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 model
- ReAct framework implementation
- Verbose output for debugging and understanding agent behavior

## Note

The example uses `gpt-4.1-mini` as the model. Make sure to update the model name in the code if you want to use a different OpenAI model.

## Basic Agent with Network Scanning Tools

The script `basic_agent_and_tools_scanner.py` demonstrates the implementation of a LangChain agent equipped with basic network scanning capabilities using nmap. The agent combines OpenAI's language models with custom tools to perform network scanning operations and time-related queries.

## Features

- Custom agent using LangChain's ReAct (Reason and Action) framework
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT models
- Network scanning capabilities using nmap
- Current time retrieval functionality

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key (set in `.env` file)
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install python-nmap langchain langchain-openai python-dotenv pydantic
  ```
- Nmap installed on your system

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Available Tools

1. **Time Tool**
   - Returns the current time in H:MM AM/PM format
   - Usage: Ask the agent about the current time

2. **Scanner Tool**
   - Performs network scanning using nmap
   - Input: IP address or range
   - Returns: List of discovered hosts

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize and run the agent
response = agent_executor.invoke({"input": "Scan the IP address 8.8.8.8"})
```

## Security Considerations

- This script performs network scanning operations which should only be used on networks you have permission to scan
- Always follow responsible security testing practices and applicable laws and regulations
- Be cautious when scanning IP addresses, as unauthorized scanning may be illegal in some jurisdictions
