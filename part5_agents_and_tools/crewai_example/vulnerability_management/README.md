# Vulnerability Management CrewAI Project

## 🛡️ Overview

A comprehensive AI-powered vulnerability management solution built with CrewAI. This project orchestrates four specialized AI agents to conduct systematic vulnerability assessments and create actionable remediation plans.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Set your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file
   - Install nmap: `brew install nmap` (macOS) or `sudo apt-get install nmap` (Ubuntu)

3. **Configure Targets**:
   Edit target systems in `src/vulnerability_management/main.py`:
   ```python
   inputs = {
       'target_systems': [
           "192.168.1.100",  # Your internal server
           "example.com",     # Your domain
           "10.0.0.1"         # Your network device
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Run Vulnerability Assessment**:
   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

## 🎯 What It Does

The vulnerability management crew follows a systematic 4-stage process:

1. **🔍 Discovery**: Scans target systems to identify vulnerabilities
2. **🔬 Analysis**: Provides detailed technical analysis of findings
3. **⚖️ Risk Assessment**: Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on business impact
4. **🛠️ Remediation Planning**: Creates actionable remediation strategies

## 👥 AI Agents

- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Network reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery
- **Vulnerability Analyst**: Technical analysis and impact assessment
- **Risk Assessor**: Business impact analysis and prioritization
- **Remediation Advisor**: Strategic remediation planning and implementation guidance

## 🔧 Tools Included

- **Nmap Scanner**: Advanced network scanning capabilities
- **CVE Lookup**: Real-time vulnerability database queries
- **Port Scanner**: Lightweight service discovery

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key
- Proper authorization for target systems
- Nmap installed (optional but recommended)

## ⚠️ Security Notice

# VulnerabilityManagement Crew

Welcome to the VulnerabilityManagement Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/vulnerability_management/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/vulnerability_management/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/vulnerability_management/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/vulnerability_management/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the vulnerability-management Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The vulnerability-management Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
